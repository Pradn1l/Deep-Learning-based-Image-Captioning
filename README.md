# Deep-Learning-based-Image-Captioning ---> Designed for tutoring
A simple deep learning based Image Captioning that is inspired by the work of Aladdin Persson. I have worked on this DIY project (few years ago) when I was in a need to switch from Tensorflow to Pytorch. The particular files in this repository were designed for my friend who I was tutoring Deep Learning and hence involves a lot of comments on the flow of the code, the logic and the needful information. Hence, this repository would serve a material for learning Pytorch, Image Captioning or Deep Learning architecture. I am always available to explain the code so feel free to write me @Pradn1l. 

File get_loader.py is the data loader and has a main to just debug and check the code. 
File model.py involves a EncoderCNN model as well as a DecoderRNN model and the logic behind merging them both. the code has detailed comments that highlight each step. 
File utils.py involve needed utilities
File train.py is the final main which calls all the respective files mentioned above and run them in the sync.

The hyperparameters need to be tuned and is left to the individual who wishes to learn from this repository. 
I actively tutor some student and would be happy to answer any questions on this work or relatable work.
